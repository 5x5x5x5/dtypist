Introduction
------------

GNU Typist (or gtypist) is free software that assists you in learning
to type correctly. This is a Rust implementation of the original C 
version, providing improved performance, memory safety, and modern 
development practices.

It is intended to be used on a raw terminal without graphics. The Rust
version maintains compatibility with all existing lesson files while
providing a more robust and maintainable codebase.

GNU Typist is GNU software. You can read recent news about the original
software in its homepage:
