"Welcome to GNU Typist!\n"
"\n"
"This message is meant to get you started using gtypist. Please read the\n"
"manual (at http://www.gnu.org/software/gtypist/doc/, or type \"info gtypist"
"\")\n"
"for more in-depth information!\n"
"\n"
"Use the arrow keys or PGUP/PGDN to scroll this window, SPACE/ENTER to start\n"
"using gtypist, or 'D' to use gtypist and never show this dialog again.\n"
"\n"
"There are two types of typing exercises: \"drills\" and \"speed tests\". In "
"a\n"
"\"drill\", gtypist displays text in every other line on the screen and "
"waits\n"
"for the user to correctly type the exact same text in the intermediate\n"
"lines. In a \"speed test\", gtypist displays text on the screen and waits\n"
"for the user to correctly type the exact same text over the top.\n"
"\n"
"In both exercise types, you have to repeat the test if your error "
"percentage\n"
"is higher than a maximum error percentage. The default is 3%, but if this "
"is\n"
"too difficult you can change it by running gtypist with the \"-e <maxpct>\"\n"
"command-line option.\n"
"\n"
"On most terminal emulators you can use Ctrl--/Ctrl-+ to resize the\n"
"terminal window. For Mac OS X, Command--/Command-+ serve this purpose.\n"
"On Windows, change the properties of the terminal window by clicking on\n"
"the top left corner of the window and choosing 'Properties'.\n"
"\n"
"Several typing courses are available from the main menu. As well as the\n"
"\"QWERTY\" courses, lessons are also available for other keyboard layouts,\n"
"such as Dvorak and Colemak, and numeric keypads. There are also other\n"
"lessons, besides the ones available on the main menu (such as the new\n"
"lesson for programmers). To see a list of the other lessons, select\n"
"\"More lessons...\" from the main menu.\n"
"To use one of these other lessons, run gtypist with the name of the lesson\n"
"file (including .typ) as a command-line argument. See the comments at the\n"
"top of each file for more information about the source and the author of\n"
"the lessons. If you want to write your own lessons, look at gtypist's\n"
"manual, it's really simple!\n"
"\n"
"If you have any questions about GNU Typist, please write to the gtypist\n"
"mailing list at <bug-gtypist@gnu.org>.\n"
